# StayNest (MERN Stack with JWT Authorization)

StayNest is an Airbnb clone built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that allows users to seamlessly browse property listings, book accommodations, and manage their profiles, similar to the Airbnb platform. The application leverages JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication and uses cookies for session management, ensuring users can safely log in, stay logged in, and interact with the platform without compromising security.

With a user-friendly interface built using React, StayNest offers advanced search functionality to filter listings based on various criteria, a robust booking system to check availability and make reservations, and an admin dashboard for managing properties. The app is designed to be scalable and maintainable, following the best practices of modern web development.

Whether you're looking for a place to stay, managing your bookings, or even hosting properties for others, StayNest provides an intuitive experience for both guests and hosts alike.
